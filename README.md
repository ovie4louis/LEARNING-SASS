About SASS
SASS is a powerful CSS preprocessor that extends CSS with features like variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more. It helps streamline your workflow and create maintainable, reusable styles.

Features
Variables: Define reusable values for colors, fonts, and more.
Nesting: Write CSS rules in a hierarchical manner for better readability.
Mixins: Create reusable blocks of CSS code.
Partials: Split your stylesheets into manageable pieces.
Inheritance: Share styles between selectors.
Functions: Perform calculations and logic in your styles.
Folder Structure
The following structure is used to organize SASS files:

├── components/   # Styles for UI components (e.g., buttons, cards)
├── layout/       # Layout styles (e.g., grid, flexbox)
